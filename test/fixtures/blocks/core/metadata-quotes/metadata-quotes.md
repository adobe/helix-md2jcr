| Description | I've made plenty of sushi at home but had yet to step     |
|             | outside the raw world of sushi-grade fish often           |
|             | associated with rolls. Plus, I'm just not that into       |
|             | imitation crab, so I was pleasantly surprised by how well |
|             | the poached walleye acted as a substitute in this recipe. |
|             | This sushi roll, or "maki," is...                         |
