As part of enrolment, you will be asked to enter several pieces of information found on the invoice, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Account Number&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Invoice Number&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Amount Due&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Invoice Date&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure to enter each value exactly as shown on the invoice. Once you’ve done so, you will be enrolled and have access to the Billing Centre.&lt;br&gt; If you do not currently receive invoices from UPS, you will first need to create a UPS.com user ID and open a payment account. If you already have an ID, you can go directly to the open a payment account step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://billing.ups.com/home&quot;&gt;Enrol Now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;/doapp/signup?loc&#x3D;en_ES&amp;#x26;returnto&#x3D;https://billing.ups.com/home&quot;&gt;Get a UPS.com Username&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;/ppc/ppc.html/payment?loc&#x3D;en_ES&quot;&gt;Add a Payment Method&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;false&lt;/p&gt;"></item_0>

Make sure you have an invoice for the account you wish to add from the previous 45 days.&lt;br&gt; You can add and remove users from the Manage Users page under Administration. Both new and existing users can be assigned one of four roles:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;View Only: This user can view and download invoices for their assigned accounts and update billing communications preferences.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;View, Pay, and Dispute: This user can add payment information to their wallet, pay invoices, and dispute charges.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Manager: This user acts as an administrator for specific accounts or plans, including assigning new users, adding payment information, paying invoices, and disputing charges.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Administrator: The Billing Centre supports multiple administrators, each of whom have full control over accounts and users.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: Before you start to add a new user, make sure you have his or her user ID and email address. You will need to choose which accounts and/or plans to assign to the user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;false&lt;/p&gt;"></item_1>

How do I continue to access and use the UPS Billing Centre?" text="&lt;p&gt;The best way to ensure continued service within the UPS Billing Centre is to proactively work with the administrator to assign a backup or secondary administrator. The Billing Centre supports multiple administrators, so we strongly encourage you to assign administrator rights to more than one user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, however, an administrator will leave the company unexpectedly. Before contacting your account representative or UPS customer service for assistance, make sure you have the previous administrator’s user ID and email address, as well as the user ID and email address of the individual who will become an administrator. This information will greatly assist us in transferring or assigning the administrator account privileges to a new user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;false&lt;/p&gt;"></item_2>
