# Why Perfectionism Kills Creativity and How to Overcome it

In Anne Lamott’s book [_Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life_](https://www.amazon.com/Bird-Some-Instructions-Writing-Life/dp/0385480016), she describes perfectionism as “the voice of the oppressor, the enemy of the people.” And while that may seen like a dramatic description, it’s undeniable that perfectionism cramps creativity and, as Lamott writes, “…will ruin your writing, blocking inventiveness and playfulness and life force.”

> Most of the times it turns out that people are just using the excuse of perfectionism to stall.

**Exorcise Perfectionism with a Simple Exercise**

Oftentimes our desire to be perfect while attaining our bigger life goals can muffle our creativity with smaller projects. Here’s a simple exercise Bruderer suggests for the next time you’re stuck with any creative endeavor no matter how big or small.

1\. Grab a piece of binder paper, your fancy journal, anything you can write on.  
2. Write the question: What would happen if I did this?  
3. Answer that question. Write and write and write everything that might happen.  
4. Write the question: What would happen if I didn’t?  
5. Think about what might happen if you let perfectionism hold you back and don’t take that step forward and write everything that might occur.

Whether it’s submitting an article to a magazine you admire, finding a space to hold your first art exhibit, or signing up for pottery classes, there’s a chance that by answering those two questions on paper, you’ll discover what steps you need to take next.

**What Are You Doing Right?**

Here other a couple of exercises that may help you when perfectionism rears its ugly head.

_1. Write down a list things (at least three) that you’re doing right._  
Instead of focusing on what (you think) you’re not doing well, take a few minutes to make a list of things you’re are doing well or that you know how to do well in relation to your goal or project. This is a great way to remind yourself of your strengths and why this is something you set out to achieve in the first place.

_2. Learn to Enjoy the Ride_  
Whether it’s an assignment for work or a personal project, make yourself work on it for 30 minutes or an hour without stopping to be critical. Just write/draw/paint/sing/play… Whatever it is, just do it. If you catch yourself stopping to reflect or criticize your progress, make yourself go forward and tell yourself you can fix it later.

_3. Do Your Best and Forget the Rest_  
Doing your best and being perfect are two very different things, especially since most of the time, only the former is realistic. When it comes to creativity, all you can do is your best. And that has to be enough. Allow yourself to recognize when you’ve done your best and to be not just okay, but happy with that.
