Cloud ERP also known as SaaS ERP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In cloud ERP, the primary licensing model is software-as-a-service (SaaS). The system provider will have its own data center—or may lease space on a public cloud to host its applications and systems. All hardware, systems, and support services are provided through the Internet. This makes implementation quicker and easier for the user company because, with all the hardware and software pieces already in place, they can start right in on the data transfer and user training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this cloud ERP deployment option, your software provider will also take care of all the installation, maintenance, and support—including any and all software updates and upgrades such as adding computing power or storage. As well, systems, applications, and resources can “autoscaled,” or increased or decreased automatically to meet changing, short-term needs. This eliminates having to pay for computing resources that may sit unused most of the time as is the case with on-premise ERP systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"/>

When viewed over the normal lifecycle cost period of five to seven years, total cost of ownership (TCO) is similar to, if not less than, an on-premise installation and offers potentially better service, support, and &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://www.sap.com/resources/erp-security&quot;&gt;security&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud ERP also offers the fastest path to innovation, making it ideal for businesses that want to aggressively pursue their digital transformation strategy. This deployment option allows companies to easily reimagine, optimize, and adapt their business processes as needed—and to take advantage of standardized best practices which modern ERP vendors should support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. On-premise ERP systems&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On-premise is how most companies historically deployed their ERP systems. In this deployment model, ERP software is installed in your data center at the locations of your choice. The installation and maintenance of the hardware and software is your staff’s responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today businesses are embracing the cloud for its flexibility, ability to scale, and ease of innovation. Though still, for some companies, especially those in highly controlled industries, on-premise is a preferable approach due to legal, regulatory, or organizational constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"/>
